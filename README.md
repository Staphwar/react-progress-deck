## This is a FORK.

- First of all big shout-out to linghuaj!
- Why the fork? I was able to get the progress deck up and running locally in a simple React app (had to add react/addons.js to lib and it worked). But as soon as I transfered it to my react-rails it kept failing on "react/addons". Forked the repository, messed around with the paths a bit and that did the trick.

[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]

- react component for generating gamification badges.
- Use cases would be: visualize achivement progress etc using materialized Badge. or loyalty reward program etc
- material design, could be easily integrate with react-tween state for animiated progressing.
- Please criticize this project and leave your feedback in issues :)
